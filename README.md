Created as a part of the coursework for CSE578 - Data Visualization. Inspired by this [research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6876013).

**Note**: This doesn't have the entire 1M row dataset. Rather this consists of a subset of the actual data presented in the course CSE578 - Data Visualization.

**Steps to Run the Project**

   - On Windows, run the terminal in administrator mode.
   - On macOS, simply open the terminal.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Change your working directory to the project folder called "fluxflow-frontend-main." You can use the `cd` command to navigate:
     ```
     cd fluxflow-frontend-main
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies using npm. Note that `npm install` may generate some errors, but you can safely skip them:
